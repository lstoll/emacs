* Installation Changes in Emacs 24.1

---
** There are new configure options:
--with-mmdf, --with-mail-unlink, --with-mailhost.
These provide no new functionality, they just remove the need to edit
lib-src/Makefile by hand in order to use the associated features.


* Startup Changes in Emacs 24.1


* Changes in Emacs 24.1

* Editing Changes in Emacs 24.1


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 24.1

** Customize

*** Customize buffers now contain a search field.
The search is performed using `customize-apropos'.
To turn off the search field, set custom-search-field to nil .

*** Custom options now start out hidden if at their default values.
Use the arrow to the left of the option name to toggle visibility.

*** custom-buffer-sort-alphabetically now defaults to t.

*** The color widget now has a "Choose" button, which allows you to
choose a color via list-colors-display.

** VC and related modes

*** vc-dir for Bzr supports viewing shelve contents and shelving snapshots.

*** Special markup can be added to log-edit buffers.

**** For Bzr, adding an
Author: NAME
line will add "--author NAME" to the "bzr commit" command.

**** For Hg, adding an
Author: NAME
line will add "--user NAME" to the "hg commit" command.

** Directory local variables can apply to file-less buffers.
For example, adding "(diff-mode . ((mode . whitespace)))" to your
.dir-locals.el file, will turn on `whitespace-mode' for *vc-diff*
buffers.

** s-region.el is now declared obsolete, superceded by shift-select-mode
enabled by default in 23.1.


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 24.1

** secrets.el is an implementation of the Secret Service API, an
interface to password managers like GNOME Keyring or KDE Wallet.  The
Secret Service API requires D-Bus for communication.

* Lisp changes in Emacs 24.1

** Image API

*** When the image type is one of listed in `image-animated-types'
and the number of sub-images in the image is more then one, then the
new function `create-animated-image' creates an animated image where
sub-images are displayed successively with the duration defined by
`image-animate-max-time' and the delay between sub-images defined
by the Graphic Control Extension of the image.
