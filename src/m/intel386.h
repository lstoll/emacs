/* The following line tells the configuration script what sort of
   operating system this machine is likely to run.

NOTE-START
Intel 386 (-machine=intel386)

  The possibilities for -opsystem are: bsd4-2, usg5-2-2, usg5-3,
  isc2-2, 386-ix, and linux.

  18.58 should support a wide variety of operating systems.
  Use linux for Linux.
  It isn't clear what to do on an SCO system.
